                  The portfolio is an important asset for any Software Engineer
                  and I finally decided to create one. I have first started
                  studying Software Engineering back in <b>2010</b> and I want
                  to have an extended version of my CV to help me stay
                  competitive on the market, find new jobs more easily and
                  express my whole experience in a single up to date place. I
                  want to give at least some visibility to my work that I've
                  spent last <b>10</b> years creating as a lot of it has "gone
                  under the radar". Hopefully, this will also be a site where I
                  can add some useful blog entries.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  So far, I have worked with Enterprise, Web, Mobile, Desktop
                  applications and other smaller scripts that have a variety of
                  purposes. I've worked with startups, small, medium or large
                  organizations that are product or service oriented. I've
                  worked with GIS, booking, media, retail, national heritage,
                  marketing and educational businesses. This helped me to
                  diversify my tech stack experience and build fundamental
                  Software Engineer qualities that stretch throughout all stages
                  of planning, design, development and production.

                  <br />
                  Business-wise, I consider myself a very competitive person,
                  but also very responsible, reliable and understanding. I like
                  to maintain a friendly and positive attitude. My main goals
                  are to establish new or <b>continuosly improve</b> the
                  existing foundations of the organization and environment I'm
                  working in.

                  My main goals of this employment (and in any new employment
                  afterwards) was to improve or create foundations for
                  continuous improvement of the processes in the company. I was
                  primarily working with Oracle EBS - a more than two decades
                  old business software which can be extended by the individual
                  units called CEMLIs. So far, this was my longest and the best
                  full time employment in terms of challenges and benefits.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This was a mix of remote, client onsite and work from office
                  where I have at one period spent 6 months away from home in
                  Bristol UK and met some great people there. The company team
                  size was circulating between 6-10 people, however, onsite work
                  required collaborating with many different and usually large
                  teams. I've spent 3 years on this role.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Main acomplishments
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  - Executed and developed more than 7 test and 1 GO LIVE data
                  migration runs for a leading student accommodation provider in
                  the UK that has more than 50000 students. The project lasted
                  for 6 months, had several different consultancy firms work on
                  the project. In the end, they successfully switched from the
                  legacy custom booking management system to Oracle EBS which
                  was customized extensively
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  - Developed several in house solutions for automated several
                  internal processes that saved hundreds of man hours if those
                  tasks were performed manually
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  - Implemented custom automated HTML notification engine that
                  allows thousands of customized emails to be sent to customers
                  each day
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  List of responsibilities:

                  <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>
                    Implemented customizations for Oracle EBS.
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  My main roles included project and production development
                  work. As said in the introduction, I was extending the Oracle
                  EBS by modifying existing or creating new CEMLIs. These
                  individual units are usually consisted of PL/SQL, SQL, Java
                  and XML objects that change the default or add new behaviour
                  to the existing software. Because Oracle EBS is so old, so are
                  the processes of building and deploying the customizations. In
                  regards to the regular work, I was also trying to build an
                  ecosystem of automation and processes around CEMLIs to improve
                  the development quality, reduce repetition and boost
                  production time.

                  <br />
                  The mobile application was built using Oracle MAF, a hybrid
                  MVC framework. My main roles on this project was to build
                  backend logic using PL/SQL, expose its logic using SOAP by
                  using ISG and then build UI logic using Javascript, Java and
                  MAF components. I have also written a middleware in Java that
                  initially just translated SOAP requests to REST. It was
                  initially meant to be extended with user subscriptions etc.
                  but it was scrapped later and the backend was converted from
                  SOAP to REST. I have also designed the architecture and
                  written part of the logic for the transformation from SOAP to
                  REST.

                  <h5>Demonstrator and a lecturer for the faculty</h5>
                  <br />
                  After I've completed my 2nd year at the faculty and have
                  mastered the className called Programming 2 - OOP in C++, I've
                  got a job at the faculty as the Programming 2 demonstrator. I
                  was a demonstrator for 2 semesters in a row and my main
                  responsibilities were to ensure that any additional topics
                  that were not covered or clear at the master className were
                  explained. I've held this className two times a week, two
                  hours per session.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In 2014, faculty professors decided that additional
                  introductory programming and database classes should be
                  introduced as a prequel to the regular faculty programme. The
                  learning curve and expectations on some of the initial
                  programming and database lectures were too steep so the
                  faculty wanted to give their students a smoother start. One of
                  my colleagues and myself have prepared and held presentations
                  and lectures for the students.
