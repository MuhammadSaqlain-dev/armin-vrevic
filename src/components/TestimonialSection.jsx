                I highly recommend Armin Vrevic to anyone needing his experience
                and specific skillset. He produced deliverables at a quick
                turnaround despite a tight (24-hour) schedule. He communicates
                well whether in writing or via phone calls and his hourly rate
                is very competitive.
                <br />
                <br /> Overall Armin would be a solid hire.

                Armin and I worked together on a Data Migration project and
                Armin has also worked for me as an Oracle developer covering
                Production Support and Development. I have found Armin to be an
                extremely talented developer who is a great at problem solving,
                hard working, focused and a great team player. I have always
                felt comfortable giving Armin the most complex tasks and letting
                him run with them, he'll ask for direction when required and
                always delivers viable solutions on time. I've enjoyed our time
                working together and have always found Armin easy to get along
                with on a personal level.

                Armin successfully carried out two different projects I
                requested him to complete. He developed an Android/iOS
                educational app which he regularly maintained and updated. With
                his excellent skills and deep expertise in web development he
                flawlessly composed a business website in a very tight schedule.
                He's very methodical, cooperative and reliable. He has an
                excellent ability to effectively manage and execute multiple
                projects simultaneously. Due to his high professional expertise
                and knowledge I strongly recommend Armin as your working partner
                or associate.

                an extremely talented developer and great team player, which is
                always here to help others. Armin always approaches to a problem
                systematically and find solution. He is very professional and
                communicative person with great ability to stay calmed in all

                when needed even under rough deadlines and heavy pressure. He
                understand how business works, and he knows software development
                processes. Also, he is master of innovation and automation.
                Armin is definitely kind of a person that everyone wants to work
                with, and I've really enjoyed working together with him.

                Armin is an impressive and talented software engineer. Not only
                is he extremely capable and competent but he also understands
                the business impact of the decisions being made and how to align
                a tech strategy to the goals of the business objective. I highly
                recommend him for any back-end or front-end software engineering
